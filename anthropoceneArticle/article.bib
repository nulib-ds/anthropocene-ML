  abstract = {The Anthropocene debate is one of the most ambitious scientific programmes of the past 15 or 20 years. Its main argument is that, from a geological point of view, humans are considered a major force of nature, thus implying that our current geological epoch is dominated by human activity. The Anthropocene has slowly become a contemporary meta-narrative that seeks to make sense of the `earth-system' as a whole, and one whose vision of the future is dystopian rather than progressive: as the exploitation of the planet's natural resources reaches tipping point, the very prospects of the continuity of human life are being questioned. This article aims to explore the implicit notions of the human -- indeed of the anthropos -- that are being mobilized in the Anthropocene debate. It will proceed in two stages: first, the article will spell out the main arguments of the Anthropocene debate with a particular focus on trying to unpack its implicit ideas of the human. Second, it will use my approach to philosophical sociology to highlight some of the limitations and contradictions of the ideas of agency, reflexivity and responsibility that underpin the Anthropocene debate.},

  abstract = {Sometimes the meaning conveyed by images goes beyond the list of objects they contain; instead, images may express a powerful message to affect the viewers' minds. Inferring this message requires reasoning about the relationships between the objects, and general common-sense knowledge about the components. In this paper, we use a scene graph, a graph representation of an image, to capture visual components. In addition, we generate a knowledge graph using facts extracted from ConceptNet to reason about objects and attributes. To detect the symbols, we propose a neural network framework named SKG-Sym. The framework first generates the representations of the scene graph of the image and its knowledge graph using Graph Convolution Network. The framework then fuses the representations and uses an MLP to classify them. We extend the network further to use an attention mechanism which learn the importance of the graph representations. We evaluate our methods on a dataset of advertisements, and compare it with baseline symbolism classification methods (ResNet and VGG). Results show that our methods outperform ResNet in terms of F-score and the attentionbased mechanism is competitive with VGG while it has much lower model complexity.},
