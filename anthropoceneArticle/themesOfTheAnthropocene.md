## Abstract
Contemporary debates about the Anthropocene focus on when the anthropocene begins. Here, we analyze three corpuses: the Chicago Novels Corpus, the Moving Image Archive, and a custom dataset generated by scraping many films that have themes of environmental conservation, human impact on the environment, and climate change. We analyze how these themes related to the anthropocene are presented across these corpuses using a novel method in computational humanities. 

## Methods

### Creating a Dataset of Moving Images
