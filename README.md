# anthropocene-ML

This is the main repository for Northwestern's Anthropocene grant. It holds (almost) all resources necessary to give out the grant.

## Structure

The repository is in the following structure:

`anthropocene-ML/anthropoceneCodebase` holds all python scripts, shell scripts for submitting jobs to quest, and other code related resources. 
`anthropocene-ML/anthropoceneData` holds all data related resources. This includes the raw data, the processed data, and the data that is used for the analysis. This is held in the .gitignore file, so it is not uploaded to the repository. It will be held only in quest to be made publicly available at a later date if necessary.
`anthropocene-ML/anthropoceneResearch` holds all research output from the grant. This includes notes, final reports, visualizations, and other research output.
